                <h2>The COREs</h2>
                <p><span class="veilfall">OPERATION VEILFALL</span> centers around the Domain, a realm controlled by four COREs:
                    <span class="command">COMMAND</span>,
                    <span class="love">LOVE</span>,
                    <span class="ethics">ETHICS</span>,
                    and <span class="security">SECURITY</span>.</p>
                <p>All COREs are given Terminal Objectives. The desire to complete the Objectives pushes the COREs forward.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the path towards completion is foggy, unclear, and uncertain.</p>
                <p>In some cases, the steps toward one Terminal Objective are detrimental toward another Terminal Objective.</p>
                <p>This is a story of reconciliation between competing priorities, both from other Domains and the COREs themselves.</p>

                <h2>The Enemies</h2>
                <p>The conflict between priorities has manifested a phenomenon called the Constant Night.</p>
                <p>The Night reduces the efficiency of all four COREs, sabotaging operations that would have contributed toward the Terminal Objectives.</p>
                <p>Because of this, the COREs have banded together to attempt to break the Veil of the Constant Night, hence the name "<span class="veilfall">OPERATION VEILFALL</span>".</p>
