        Hello. I am Steven.
        <br>I'm not much of a social person, at least to those I am not famiilar with.
        <br>To those who I <b>am</b> familiar with, it depends.
        <br>Two of my most predominant pastimes are listed below.

    <h2>Skill/Hobby: Programming in Java for KTBYTE</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <a href="https://www.ktbyte.com/"><img src="ktbyte.png" alt="KTBYTE logo" width=25% height=25% class="center"></a>
      <p>
        So, about two years ago, my parents recommended me this online computer science school called <a href="https://www.ktbyte.com/">KTBYTE</a>, which primarily teaches Java.
        Before Java, however, KTBYTE teaches Processing (a language based off Java). I used Processing to make a variety of
        <a href="https://www.ktbyte.com/user/143641">projects</a>, some of which I made for last year's minutes gifts and some of which I
        can only classify as random stuff I made out of boredom, curiosity, or inspiration. This is where I also learned about some basics
        of Java, including data types, classes, recursion, and 2D arrays. Now, I've moved into actual Java and I've learned about
        data structures, inheritance (including polymorphism), interfaces, generic data types, exceptions, and abstract classes.
        I am now learning about sorting algorithms and slowly making my way towards competitive programming.

    <h2>Hobby: Reading from the SCP Wiki</h2>
    <div class="content">
    <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/"><img src="SCPF.png" alt="SCP Foundation logo" width=25% height=25% class="center"></a>
      <p>
        To summarize, the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/">SCP Wiki</a> is a collaborative fiction project centralizing around
        "The Foundation," an organization that protects humanity by containing, using, or destroying anomalies that, in some way, break
        natural law. Although it started in the horror genre, the SCP Wiki also dips its hand into other genres such as science fiction,
        mystery, fantasy. I enjoy reading stories from this website because it has a variety of concepts, it is concise and mostly not
        filled with unnecessary details, and it does not have one central storyline -- the reader can decide to accept a story as part of
        their own imagined storyline or reject it.
      </p>
      I selected a number of favorite articles and chose a quote for each of them. 
      <br>Some of these contain swearing, but it makes the characters more realistic and does not impede the storytelling.
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2747">SCP-2747</a> - As Below, So Above || Author: "minmin"</li>
        "It can effect through layers of metafictional narrative, i.e. a metanarrative containing the <i>anafabula</i> will cease to exist within the narrative, followed by the narrative itself disappearing from our reality."
        <li><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3125">SCP-3125</a> - The Escapee || Author: "qntm"</li>
        "Because humans have no natural exposure to ideas as aggressive as SCP-3125, human minds have no protective evolutionary adaptations against it."
        <br><b>Note: If you want to read this article, the passcode is 55555.</b>
        <li><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4999">SCP-4999</a> - Someone to Watch Over Us || Author: "CadaverCommander"</li>
        "SCP-4999 will then remain with the subject, silent and unmoving, until they have passed away."
        <li><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5000">SCP-5000</a> - Why? || Author: "Tanhony"</li>
        "Due to circumstances outside of our control, this directive has now changed. Our new mission will be the extermination of the human race."
        <li><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5242">SCP-5242</a> - SCP-INTEGER || Author: "Placeholder McD"</li>
        "SCP-INTEGER is, has always been, and will always be identified using names that it has retroactively caused to be factually correct, and the use of any other identifier is considered incorrect."
        <li><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6511">SCP-6511</a> - OBLIVION ACCESS || Author: "Modulum"</li>
        "You are the designated survivor of the SCP Foundation. As of your reading of this text, the SCP Foundation has been dissolved effective immediately."
        <li><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6630">SCP-6630</a> - Fire on the Horizon || Author: "T Rutherford"</li>
        "Oh! The Foundation would never interfere with ex-employees' future career aspirations, Ms. Boone! We're very sorry to hear you're having a difficult time finding a new position. We know the <i>economy is in terrible shape right now</i>."
        <br><b>Caution: Due to the nature of this story, there is more than a mild amount of swearing.</b>
        <li><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6659">SCP-6659</a> - METAGNOSTIC || Author: "DodoDevil"</li>
        "While these memetic constructs are worshipped as deities, they each are only another anomaly to be understood and will be treated as such."
        <li><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ethics-committee-orientation">Ethics Committee Orientation</a> || Author: "Voct"</li>
        "We are against unnecessary cruelty. Which means somebody has to decide when cruelty <i>is</i> necessary. And that somebody is us."
        <li><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-nuclear-option">The Nuclear Option</a> || Author: "Captain Kirby"</li>
        "It would be a regrettable path, but we would be successful in our mission. A world of fire and brimstone is well within normalcy."
        <li><a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/in-the-trenches-with-the-dead">In the Trenches with the Dead</a> || Author: "sirpudding"</li>
        "Whenever (and wherever) this information is detected an incursion occurs, resulting in a manifestation of anti-memetically cloaked arachnoid organisms supported by sustained infolaser assault."
